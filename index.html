            <h2>Research</h2>
            <ul class="research-list">
                <li>My current research focus lies at the intersection of algebra, combinatorics, topology, and computation. I am always interested when deep theory and ad hoc methods can reduce infinite problems to finite ones, which can be resolved with computer algebra systems. I have also recently got very much into the application of AI architectures to solve -- or at least provide evidence for -- hard theoretical problems.</li>
                
                <li>My postdoctoral mentors were <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~asnowden/">Andrew Snowden</a> and <a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/njp/">Nicholas Proudfoot</a></li>

                <li> I am a co-organizer for the <a href = "https://www.nycombinatorics.org/crw2025">NY Combinatorics research workshop</a></li>
