<h2>Math</h2>


<li>My current research focus lies at the intersection of algebra, combinatorics, topology, and computation. I am always interested when deep theory and ad hoc methods can reduce infinite problems to finite ones, which can be resolved with computer algebra systems.</li>
<br>

<li> My previous postdoctoral mentors were <a href = "http://www-personal.umich.edu/~asnowden/">Andrew Snowden</a> and <a href = "http://pages.uoregon.edu/njp/">Nicholas Proudfoot</a></li></li>
<br>

<li> My Ph.D. advisor was <a href = "http://math.wisc.edu/~ellenber">Jordan Ellenberg</a> </li>
