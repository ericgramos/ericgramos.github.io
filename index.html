<li>My primary research focus is in combinatorics and its interactions with representation theory, topology, and algebraic geometry. I am particularly interested in using the representation theories of certain combinatorially flavored categories to exhibit and explain certain stability phenomena throughout topology, algebraic geometry, and other fields. More recently I have also been incorporating a number of computational and quantitative methods into my work.</li>
