    "# Program for finding independence numbers of vertex-quadratic FI-graphs (where the second degree only comes from the unordered pairs)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a small program of constructing an FI-graph whose vertices are either one of the followings: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Unlabelled; \n",
    "2. Labelled by a single number; or \n",
    "3. Labelled by an unordered set of two distinct numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "This program also provides a method to find the independence number and print out a random maximum-size independent set for each $G_n$; however, this requires the constructed FI-graph to be simple enough given the \n",
    "extremely high time complexity of searching for the independent sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification graphs \n",
    "\n",
    "### How does classification graphs look like in our case?\n",
    "\n",
    "By the classification theorem of this type of FI-graph, we can construct the FI-graph by first creating its\n",
    "classification graph. For a vertex-quadratic graph where the second degree exclusively comes from the \n",
    "unordered pairs, there are three types of vertices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $v^{(2)}$ represents $\\textbf{unordered-pair orbit } \\mathcal{O}_{\\{a,b\\}}$;\n",
    "2. $v^{(3)}$ represents $\\textbf{linear-growth orbit } \\mathcal{O}_a$;\n",
    "3. $v^{(4)}$ represents $\\textbf{singleton orbit } \\mathcal{O}_0$;\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have three types of loops around individual vertices: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. $e_1^{(2)}$ indicates that every two vertices with disjoint labels in the corresponding $\\mathcal{O}_{\\{a,b\\}}$ are connected;\n",
    "2. $e_2^{(2)}$ indicates that every two vertices with one-common-number label in the corresponding $\\mathcal{O}_{\\{a,b\\}}$ are connected;\n",
    "3. $e_1^{(3)}$ indicates that every two vertices in the corresponding $\\mathcal{O}_{a}$ are connected, so $\\mathcal{O}_{a}$ forms a complete graph itself;\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification graph also has the following possible edges; \n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each $j$ between $1$ and $3$, $e_j^{(2,2)}$ indicates that every two vertices, one from each corresponding $\\mathcal{O}_{\\{a,b\\}}$'s, are connected if their labels share $j-1$ common numbers; \n",
    "2. For $j = 1$ or $2$, $e_j^{(2,3)}$ indicates that every two vertices, one from the corresponding $\\mathcal{O}_{\\{a,b\\}}$ and the other from the corresponding $\\mathcal{O}_{a}$, are connected if their labels share $j-1$ common numbers;\n",
    "3. For $j = 1$ or $2$, $e_j^{(3,3)}$ indicates that every two vertices, one from each corresponding $\\mathcal{O}_{a}$'s, are connected if their labels share $j-1$ common numbers;\n",
    "4. $e_1^{(x,4)}$ indicates that the singleton vertex from the corresponding $\\mathcal{O}_{0}$ is connected to every vertex in the other orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we should prevent from inputing a graph with multiedges and loops since the data structure of graphs in Sagemath are matrices, which always indicates simple graphs without loops. Due to the limitation of the structure of our program, we need to require our classification graph to be finite simple graph without any loops. Therefore, when we input a classification graph and want to output the resulting FI-graph, we should turn our classification graph into the slightly altered form, as explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we modify our classification graphs so that it is applicable in our program?\n",
    "\n",
    "The (modified) classification graph consists of 7 different types of vertices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Vertex type \"A\": same as $v^{(4)}$;\n",
    "2. Vertex type \"B\": same as $v^{(3)}$;\n",
    "3. Vertex type \"C\": same as $v^{(3)}$ with $e_1^{(3)}$, i.e. represents a complete graph $K_n$;\n",
    "4. Vertex type \"D\": same as $v^{(2)}$;\n",
    "5. Vertex type \"E\": same as $v^{(2)}$ with $e_1^{(2)}$, i.e. represents a Kneser graph $KG_{n, 2}$;\n",
    "6. Vertex type \"F\": same as $v^{(2)}$ with $e_2^{(2)}$. i.e. represents a Johnson graph $J_{n, 2}$;\n",
    "7. Vertex type \"G\": same as $v^{(2)}$ with both $e_1^{(2)}$ and $e_2^{(2)}$, i.e. represents a complete graph $K_{\\binom{n}{2}}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, there may be up to 7 different kinds of edges between any two vertices of the (modified) classification graph, depending on the types of the vertices at both ends. \n",

    "## Cell 2: Customization of FI-graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell is for users to customize by implementing the (modified) classification graphs into the code and output the corresponding FI-Graph and calculate the independecence number for each $G_n$'s! Below is a user manual about how to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Note:}$ If the user instead want to quickly generate a lot different FI-graphs at the same time and look at their independence numbers, then please go to $\\textbf{Cell 3}$ for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How are graphs represented in Sagemath?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Sagemath, vertices in a (finite, simple) graph are labelled by non-negative integers $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, etc, and the graph is represented by a symmetric square matrix such that the index $[i,j]$ is $\\mathbf{1}$ if the vertices labelled $i$ and $j$ are connected by an edge, and $\\mathbf{0}$ otherwise (in particular, all entries on the top-left-bottom-right diagonal will be $\\mathbf{0}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we input classification graph to obtain the corresponding FI-graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create the correct corresponding FI-graph from the classification graph, the user should do the followings: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Come up with the classification graph that you would like to explore, and convert it into the modified version of the classification graph following the instructions we provided at the beginning.\n",
    "2. $\\textbf{Label}$ the vertices with $\\mathbf{0}$, $\\mathbf{1}$, $\\mathbf{2}$, ... such that the vertices of the type $\\textbf{earlier}$ in alphabetical order always have $\\textbf{smaller}$ labels. For example, if the classification graph consists of 3 vertices of \"A\", 2 vertices of \"C\", 1 vertex of \"D\", 2 vertices of \"F\" and 5 vertices of type-G, then the \"A\" vertices will be labelled $\\mathbf{0}$-$\\mathbf{2}$, \"C\" labelled $\\mathbf{3}$-$\\mathbf{4}$, \"D\" labelled $\\mathbf{5}$, \"F\" labelled $\\mathbf{6}$-$\\mathbf{7}$ and \"G\" labelled $\\mathbf{8}$-$\\mathbf{12}$. (Note: the reason to start with $\\mathbf{0}$ is that the indices of matrices in this programming language start with 0 instead of 1.) Also, calculate how many vertices there are in the classification graph (in this example, it is $13$.)\n",
    "3. Provide information about how many vertices are there in the classification graph that are \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\" and \"F\" and \"G\", respectively; the program will calculate the total number of vertices by taking a sum of these numbers. In the above example, we should have \n",
    "    * numOfA = 3;\n",
    "    * numOfB = 0;\n",
    "    * numOfC = 2;\n",
    "    * numOfD = 1;\n",
    "    * numOfE = 0; \n",
    "    * numOfF = 2; and\n",
    "    * numOfG = 5.\n",
    "4. Create an empty square matrix whose number of rows and columns equals to the size of the classification graph. (In the example above, this will be a $13$-by-$13$ matrix.) This step is automatically fulfilled by our code.\n",
    "5. If there is an edge named '$k$' between vertices labelled $\\mathbf{i}$ and $\\mathbf{j}$ where $i < j$, then fill in the number '$k$' to the $[i, j]$-entry of the matrix. (Note: in principle, we also need to fill '$k$' to the $[j, i]$-entry of the matrix, because graphs are usually represented as symmetric matrices. However, the code is designed such that it is enough the assume that $i$ is smaller than $j$; in other words, we only need to deal with entries in the upper-right half of this square matrix.)\n",
    "\n",
    "After inputing the above information, the code below will use the method \"createGnMatrix\" in a \"for\" loop to convert this classification graph into a matrix for each $G_n$ that are not too big (around $8$ to $15$). Then we can using built-in methods from Sagemath to convert them to \"Graph\" objectd and calculate their independence numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature to display a maximum-size independent set\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an additional feature of this method we have provided: it can show a random maximum-size independent set in $G_n$ corresponding to the independence number (although if you ran the same information again, the maximum-size independent sets are the same ones because the built-in methods of Sagemath have some certain logic to operate.) The vertices of the maximum-size independent set are shown by their actual labels; for example, \n",
    "\n",
    "   * ('A', m) represents the singleton vertex of the $m^{\\text{th}}$-orbit of type \"A\";\n",
    "   * ('B'/'C', m, i) represents the vertex labelled $i$ in the $m^{\\text{th}}$-orbit of type \"B/C\"; and\n",
    "   * ('D'/'E'/'F'/'G', m, i, j) represents the vertex labelled $\\{i,j\\}$ in the $m^{\\text{th}}$-orbit of type \"D/E/F/G\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In such way it allows the user to explore and guess the possible pattern of maximum-size independent sets combinatorially. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Important note about displaying more maximum-size independent sets\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, we also made a method in $\\textbf{Cell 5}$ which allows the user to see all the maximum-size independent sets for every $G_n$. However, that method has an extremely high computational complexity, so it barely works as soon as the user input classification that are slightly complicated. We provide it as a backup method by the end of this file, and the user can use it to deeply explore an FI-graph that is simple enough. In fact, even the method in this cell is not fast enough and will crush if the classification graph gets too complicated. We recommend the user to $\\textbf{restrict the total number of vertices in}$ $\\textbf{classification graph to single-digit}$ so that the code can function properly most of the time."

    "## Cell 3: Supporting methods of random FI-graph generator\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some supporting methods to generate random classification graphs nice and quickly. By default, the method getRandomC_Graph() generate a random classification graph with at most $10$ vertices in total, and among them at most $3$ represent quadratic orbits (namely, D/E/F/G); also, at most $10$ edges are allowed. We set these numbers so that the classification graphs are simple enough, although the user can change these parameters freely. The methods are carefully designed so that the classification graph will be overall random, and the type of vertices splited evenly overall (which means that will not be significantly more \"D\"'s then \"G\"'s if running the method repeatedly.) The type of edges are also splited evenly. The user can use the actual implementation in $\\textbf{Cell 4}$ by repeatedly running that cell. "
